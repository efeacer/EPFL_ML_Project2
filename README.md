# EPFL_ML_Project2 

## Machine Learning Algorithms for Recommender Systems

The second project of the EPFL Machine Learning course, which aims to construct a Recommender 
System with good predictive performance using various Machine Learning Algorithms. The given
report explains our machine learning procedure in detail together with the well documented python 
code in the scripts folder.
